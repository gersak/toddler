## Intro
Modal components are UI elements that overlay the main 
content of an application to capture the userâ€™s attention
and prompt them to take action. They are typically used
for tasks such as displaying alerts, gathering input,
or confirming actions.

Modals are often styled as pop-up windows and are designed
to be contextually relevant, requiring users to interact
with them before returning to the main interface.


## MODAL BACKGROUND

As you can see in code bellow, modal-background component will
use react/createPortal to mount modal backround on popup/*container* 
node and pass component children to mounted div (one with :key ::background)

Optional properties for modal-background component include:

 * **can-close?** - controls if on-close can be called
 * **on-close** - when clicked on background will call on-close fn

<div id="modal-background-example"></div>

```clojure
(defnc modal-background
  [{:keys [class className can-close? on-close]
    :or {can-close? true
         on-close identity}
    :as props}]
  (let [container-node (hooks/use-context popup/*container*)]
    (rdom/createPortal
     (d/div
      {:key ::background
       :on-click (fn [] (when can-close? (on-close)))
       :class (cond-> [$modal-background
                       (when-not can-close? " block ")]
                (string? class) (conj class)
                (sequential? class) (into class)
                (string? className) (conj className))
       & (dissoc props :class :className :can-close? :on-click :onClick)}
      (c/children props))
     @container-node)))
```

## MODAL DIALOG

Dialog component will create dialog window and adjust its 
size to inside content. Same as modal-background it supports 
on-close handler, that will be called when user clicks 
outside of dialog window. If omitted you will have to 
handle modal closing by some other means. Like button or something similar.

There are some styled features that come with dialog 
component out of the box. This features are activated 
by adding class to content that is added to ui/modal-dialog component


 * **title** - Stating the purpose of modal-dialog. To emphisize current state
 * **content** - Adding content class will add padding to match footer and title
 * **footer** - Common place to add buttons, so this 
 class will add styles for displaying buttons in common fashion


<div id="modal-dialog-example"></div>


```clojure
(defnc dialog-example
  [{:keys [opened? context]}]
  (use-register :toddler.modal.background "background")
  (use-register :toddler.modal.dialog "dialog")
  (let [close! (use-close)
        translate (toddler/use-translate)]
    (when opened?
      ($ ui/modal-dialog
         {:on-close close!
          :width 300
          :className (when context (name context))}
         (d/span
          {:className "title"}
          (translate :showcase.modal.dialog.title))
         (d/div
          {:class "content"
           :style {:max-width 400}}
          (d/pre
           {:className (css :mt-4 :word-break :whitespace-pre-wrap)}
           (translate :showcase.content.large)))
         (d/div
          {:className "footer"}
          ($ ui/button {:on-click close!} (translate :ok))
          ($ ui/button {:on-click close!} (translate :cancel)))))))
```
