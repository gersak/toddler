# Rows and Columns
Components are working on [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
layout properties. Both will try to fill available space and grow as much as possible.

Both `column` and `row` accept `:position` or `:align` value with one of 4 available
options:

 * **:start**   - start displaying elements from start
 * **:center**  - group elements at center 
 * **:end**     - group elements at the end of row/column
 * **:explode** - move elements away from each other as much as possible


By combining rows/columns and alignment and other css properties it is
not that hard to create __complex__ stable layout.
